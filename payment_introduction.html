            <h1>Payments introduction</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
              Here we’ll make a little introduction to some topics that you should understand in order to handle payments with our SDK’s help.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s see from a few definitions:
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Payment method:</b> could be cards (credit, debit, prepaid), atm (cash machine), tickets. Each payment method has its particularities. When buying online with atm or ticket payments,they remain pending until the “real” payment is made. On the other hand, cards usually make instant payments (although, there could be issues that will retain it a while, or could cause a rejection).
              </p>

              <p>
              <b>Debit and credit cards:</b> cards have a card number, holder name, expiry date and a security code. Getting that information and the holder’s identification number, you can make a payment.
              </p>
              <p>
              <b>Card BIN (bank identification number):</b> first six digits of the card number.
              </p>
              <p>
              <b>Card validations:</b> there are some validations you must make over this data:
              <br>
              Card data must be matched with the payment method. A payment method determines how a card has to be validated: it’s card number length, how it has to be validated (by Luhn’s algorithm, for example) and the security code length. Also, you must validate the expiry date of the card (that it didn’t expire).
              This validations are provided by our SDK, as you’ll see later.
              </p>
              <p>
              <b>Issuer:</b> it’s the entity that gives the card (usually a bank). In some cases, It can be identified with the card’s BIN.
              </p>
              <p>
              <b>Installments:</b> a payment can be made in installments. It’s interest depends on the payment method and the issuer, so you must have that information to offer payments in installments.
              </p>
              <p>
              <b>Bank deals:</b> issuers may offer deals (promotions) to it’s customers for some payment methods.
              </p>
              <p>
              <b>Payment:</b> in order to make one, you must have collected at least the payment method and card data. If you also want to offer installments, you’ll have to collect (if needed, as it may be identified just by the BIN) issuer information.
              </p>
              <p>
              Our SDK will help you to know what data you must collect (if issuer is required or not, for example), and then retrieve and validate it.
